Every software system is bound to experience failures at some point, and these failures can stem from a diverse range of factors: including bugs, sudden surges in user traffic, security vulnerabilities, hardware malfunctions, natural disasters, and human errors. Experiencing failure is a normal part of the software development process and presents a valuable opportunity for learning and enhancement. An adept Software Engineer must internalize lessons from these failures to prevent their recurrence. While encountering failures is acceptable, allowing the same issue to cause failure repeatedly is not.

In the realm of the technology industry, a commonly employed tool is the postmortem. Following any instance of system downtime or malfunction, the responsible teams compile a report with two primary objectives:

1. To furnish the company's entire workforce with an easily accessible account detailing the reasons behind the outage. Given that these outages can significantly impact a company, it's imperative for managers and executives to comprehend the events that transpired and the implications for their operations.

2. To confirm the identification of the root cause(s) behind the outage and to implement measures that ensure its resolution. This not only involves addressing the immediate issue but also preventing its recurrence through proactive steps.

In essence, this practice enables teams to learn from failures, enhance their systems, and ensure the organization's continued reliability and success.
